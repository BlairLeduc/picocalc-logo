# picocalc-logo

This project implements a dialect of the computer language Logo for the PicoCalc. The dialect is based upon Berkley Logo, with some modifications to fit the constraints of the Picocalc, but with enhanced features to leverage the capabilities of the Picocalc.

Logo is a programming language known for its use in education, particularly in teaching programming concepts through turtle graphics. The PicoCalc Logo interpreter allows users to write Logo programs that can control the turtle graphics on the PicoCalc device.

## Features

- 320Ã—320 resolution with 65K colour graphics with three display modes: full screen text for programs without graphics, full screen graphics for running graphical programs, and split screen for interactive use.

## Getting Started

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/picocalc-logo/releases).

Put your PicoCalc into bootloader mode by holding down the "BOOT" button while powering it on. Then, copy the UF2 file to the USB drive that appears.
